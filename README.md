Gemini Chat Interface with Streamlit
Overview
The Gemini Chat Interface is an educational and practical project designed to showcase the capabilities of Google's cutting-edge large language model, Gemini, through an accessible and user-friendly platform built with Streamlit. This interface allows users to explore and interact with advanced language model applications, providing a seamless experience that bridges the gap between complex AI technology and everyday usability.

Mission
Our mission is to provide an accessible platform that introduces users to the powerful capabilities of large language models like Gemini. This project serves as both an educational tool and a practical demonstration of how AI can be integrated into user-friendly applications.
